# Site Analysis & Migration Prep: dickensandballsworth.com

## Phase 1: Site Discovery

Browse https://dickensandballsworth.com and perform a comprehensive analysis:

1. **Site Structure**
   - Map all pages and navigation hierarchy
   - Document the URL structure
   - Identify any subdomains or external links

2. **Content Inventory** (for each page found)
   - Page title and purpose
   - Text content (headings, paragraphs, any bio/description text)
   - Images (note URLs, approximate dimensions, context/purpose)
   - Embedded media (Spotify, YouTube, Bandcamp, SoundCloud, etc.)
   - Any interactive elements (forms, calendars, booking widgets)

3. **Design Analysis**
   - Color palette (primary, secondary, accent colors - grab hex codes if visible)
   - Typography style (serif/sans-serif, general vibe)
   - Layout patterns (hero images, grid layouts, etc.)
   - Overall aesthetic (describe the mood/feel)

4. **External Integrations**
   - Social media links and platforms
   - Any third-party widgets or embeds (calendar services, music platforms, mailing list)
   - Contact/booking mechanisms

## Phase 1 Deliverable

Create a markdown report called `site-analysis.md` with your findings, organized by page. Include a summary section at the top with:
- Total page count
- Total images found (with URLs)
- Key integrations identified
- Recommended approach for migration

Ask me any clarifying questions before proceeding to asset download or site construction.
